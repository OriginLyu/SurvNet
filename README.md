# SurvNet
This is a code and link to dataset which is used in our manuscript entitled 'SurvNet: A Low-Complexity Convolutional Neural Network for Survival Time ClassiÔ¨Åcation of Patients with Glioblastoma'.

This project is built up using TensorFlow and Keras.

The dataset links to TCGA-GBM(https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1966258) and a pre-operative TCGA-GBM dataset(https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=24282666), which is publicly available. 
TCGA-GBM provides the raw MRI image(DICOM format), gene data, and relative clinical information, while pre-operative TCGA-GBM consists of the pre-processed MRI images in nifti format, obtained from TCGA-GBM.
